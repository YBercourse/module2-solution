            <br>I sleep longer and get up slowly. I make coffee by myself, and then plan a to-do list for a day ahead. Finally, there is time for what I've never had time to do previously: read a book, listen to a podcast and water the flowers (it turns out they should be green!)...</br>

            <br> I'm not driving anywhere (which is a little frustrating), but I began to communicate more with friends! I've learned about them a lot: before, we were never able to see each other so often (albeit on FaceTime) and call up. It turns out they are interesting people. </br>

            <br>I'm sitting at home again. Began to communicate with my family more (although now on FaceTime only). It turns out that sunsets from my window are amazingly beautiful, the food is even nicer to eat at home, and there are so much interesting things on Netflix!..</br>
